# python-github-assignment
The assignment introduces basic python. You will write a Python program where the user will be asked to input some data, where a calculation will be done, where some error handling will be provided and where the result will be printed. The steps are to be done individually and notated in a README, and uploaded to a public Gulfstream GIT repository.
